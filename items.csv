Help Desıgn and Buıld a Devıce to Test Small Electronıcs,full-time,https://newyork.craigslist.org/brk/egr/d/brooklyn-help-desgn-and-buld-devce-to/6776808550.html,"
        
I'm looking for someone to help me develop a simple device to assist with the testing of small, battery-operated electronics.

I recently purchased a lot of hundreds of old Game Boy Pockets that I want to resell, but I need to test each end every one to see if they're all working first, so I don't inadvertently sell broken merchandise.  This product takes 2 AA batteries, but I don't have time to put in and take out the batteries hundreds of times.  Instead, I'd like to build a handheld (or some other type of) battery-pack which clips onto the back of each Game Boy that well allow me to test these Game Boy Pockets quickly and easily, without having to put batteries in and out of each one.

This so-called ""game-boy tester"" is simply a 2xAA battery pack, with a built-in clip that allows you to easily clip the battery pack onto the back of the Game Boy, where the battery terminals are.  The ""clip"" will probably have to be 3D-printed so it fits well.

I'm looking for someone who can build me a kick-ass tester - someone with experience with building/prototyping small gadgets and mechanical devices, 3D-printing, etc., who can use good materials and make something strong and sturdy that can withstand the testing of hundreds or thousands of pieces.

Please reply to this ad if you think you can help me build this thing.  I'm offering $250, but I'll most-likely want to enlist some helpers to help with the testing, so we may need to make additional testers, and I will pay another $100 for each additional tester (plus the cost of materials).

We've won frequent awards, as well as the loyalty of some of the premier clients in the region -- public, corporate and residential.  Our work embraces all components of the building envelope and underlying structure - facades, roofs, windows, and plazas - and the full complement of materials, from landmark terra cotta to high performance curtain walls. We take pride in being an industry leader in such practice areas as Local Law 11 inspections and repairs. 

We work in teams. Teams are assigned to projects based on synergies between project requirements and the capabilities of each team member. This arrangement offers employees the dual advantages of a ""small office experience"" coupled with access to the centralized resources of a larger firm. You'll be supported by some of the most sophisticated technology in the profession, including proprietary computer systems and applications, advanced photography and image processing, and state of the art non-destructive diagnostic equipment and techniques.  

Employees typically participate in all phases of a project from inception through completion: proposal, investigation, construction documents, bid negotiation, and construction administration. You'll have the opportunity to see the designs you draw executed in the field, and you'll take on greater responsibility and client exposure as soon as you are ready.  

Frequent lunchtime seminars by industry experts, including our own in-house personnel, keep us current on developments in the profession (with the additional benefit of a free lunch).  

SUPERSTRUCTURES offers top-level compensation for top-level people, and the advancement potential of a thriving company.
